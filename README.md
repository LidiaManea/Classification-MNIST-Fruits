# Classification-MNIST-Fruits
A two-part machine learning project implementing traditional ML algorithms and deep neural networks for image classification tasks.

Overview
Comparison of traditional machine learning algorithms on two image datasets: Fruits Dataset and Fashion-MNIST

Feature Extraction: PCA: 27 components for dimensionality reduction and Hu Moments: Contour-based shape descriptors

Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Deep Convolutional Network, CNN with Data Augmentation, Pre-trained ResNet18
